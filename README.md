# RPG-Portals
Spigot Plugin 1.14.4

Have you always wanted your own portal like a magician in the world's most famous MMORPG, but in Minecraft.
Then this is the right plugin for you.

Only one command opens the GUI. There you can choose where the portal should lead.
You can choose between a portal to your own bed spawn or rather in the end.

If Towny is installed you can create a portal to your own city or to all public cities.

The portal will then be created a few blocks in the player's direction of view and will last 30 seconds, during which time all players with permission can pass through the portal.

This plugin is in alpha, that means there will be some updates to follow. Since it is my first plugin and also my first program in Java I would be happy about issues on Github to fix problems quickly.

To do:
- Public town multi page support
- Material requirements a player needs to create a portal.
- Vault support, maybe pay for a portal creation
- config.yml to change settings
- Support different languages

Commands:
- /rpgp

Permissions:
- rpgp.portal (allows to travel through portals)
- rpgp.opengui (allows to open the GUI)

- rpgp.hometown (allows you to create a portal to your city)
